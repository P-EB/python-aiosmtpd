python-aiosmtpd (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Drop support for Python 3.4.
    - As per RFC 5321, §4.1.4, multiple HELO / EHLO commands in the
      same session are semantically equivalent to RSET. (Closes #78)
    - As per RFC 5321, $4.1.1.9, NOOP takes an optional argument,
      which is ignored. API BREAK If you have a handler that implements
      handle_NOOP(), it previously took zero arguments but now requires
      a single argument. (Closes #107)
    - The command line options --version / -v has been added to print
      the package’s current version number. (Closes #111)
    - General improvements in the Controller class. (Closes #104)
    - When aiosmtpd handles a STARTTLS it must arrange for the
      original transport to be closed when the wrapped transport is
      closed. This fixes a hidden exception which occurs when an EOF is
      received on the original tranport after the connection is
      lost. (Closes #83)
    - Widen the catch of ConnectionResetError and CancelledError to
      also catch such errors from handler methods. (Closes #110)
    - Added a manpage for the aiosmtpd command line script. (Closes #116)
    - Added much better support for the HELP. There’s a new decorator
      called @syntax() which you can use in derived classes to decorate
      smtp_*() methods.  These then show up in HELP responses. This also
      fixes HELP responses for the LMTP subclass. (Closes #113)
    - The Controller class now takes an optional keyword argument
      ssl_context which is passed directly to the asyncio
      create_server() call.
